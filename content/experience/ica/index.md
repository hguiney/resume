The Institute of Contemporary Art regularly contracted me for various projects. As a Digital Studio Instructor, I conducted classes demonstrating professional media tools to students of all ages and experience levels. Alternately leading and assisting, I had to coordinate on two-person teams to help bring those lagging behind in lessons up to speed without slowing down the rest of the class. This required routinely breaking down technical concepts into laymanâ€™s terms. As an Event Videographer, I also shot and edited a number of stage performances for archival and promotional purposes.
