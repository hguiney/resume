Promoboxx is a marketing platform that allows local businesses to co-brand with national ad campaigns, sponsored by the brands they sell. I worked on a growing team of 20 at this Boston startup. Starting as a general UI/UX developer, I was promoted to Lead Marketing Developer, specializing in developing the advertising platform, designing landing pages, and training non-technical team members. I worked with clients such as Volkswagen, Pepsi, and Reebok to create Facebook apps, as well as standalone web applications.
