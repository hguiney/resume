While working for RunKeeper, a Boston-based startup heralded by GigaOm as “The Facebook of Fitness”, I implemented a redesign of their HealthGraph companion site, which provides API documentation and plugin generators to developers looking to build apps on top of their platform of over 6 million users. Not only did I increase usability across devices by converting the entire site to a semantic, responsive layout, but I also reworked the documentation to make the content easier to understand, navigate, and manage.
